# Intro and Thanks

This is a memory card-match game project for the "Web Programming With JavaScript" class.
As such, it is HEAVILY RIPPED OFF from the starter project provided at https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game.

After working a few hours with the starter project as a basis, I decided I would be more comfortable with the tools if I managed
to build everything myself from scratch.

THANKS UDACITY

## Dependancies

This relies on a fontAwesome.io jS script they generated; see index.HTML header.
