# Intro and Thanks

This is a memory card-match game project for the "Web Programming With JavaScript" class.
As such, it is HEAVILY RIPPED OFF from the starter project provided at https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game.

After working a few hours with the starter project as a basis, I decided I would be more comfortable with the tools if I managed
to build everything myself from scratch.

THANKS UDACITY

THANKS FONTAWESOME.IO FOR YOUR COOL ICONS

THANKS ANIMATE.CSS

#### Dependancies

This relies on a fontAwesome.io JS script they generated; see index.HTML header.

## Setup

To install and play the game, simply copy all the files from this repository to your device
and execute index.html with your web browser.

## Rules

There are 16 cards on the board, divided into 8 different pairs.

Reveal two cards by clicking them, if they match, they will stay revealed.

You win the game by revealing all 16 cards.

You also get a star rating depending on your performance; less than 12 moves will
get you 3 stars, less than 18 moves will give you 2 stars and everything over that
will only net you 1 star.

("Move" here is the whole act of turning two cards and comparing them :P)
